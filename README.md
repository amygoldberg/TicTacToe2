# TicTacToe

## Objectives
- Use index.html, style.css and tictactoe2.js files to create a working tictactoe game
- User stories and how users play
- Commit project at various times to my git repo

## Instructions

1. Open app using link: ***Github repo URL?
2. Start the game by first player choosing a spot on the board - first player becomes 'X'
3. Take turns playing until one user wins or until there is a tie game (will be alerted in either case)
4. Restart game at any time (mid-game or after a tie, or one player has won) by pressing the 'New Game' button
